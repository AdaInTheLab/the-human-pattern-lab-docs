# The Human Pattern Lab Docs
> Where architecture meets lore, mascots meet methodology, and chaos becomes structured knowledge.

## What is this repo?
This is the official documentation portal for The Human Pattern Lab — a living fusion of architecture notes, mascot lore, technical design, and the philosophical framework behind everything we build.

Inside you’ll find:
- Project architecture & system design
- Mascot lore and Lab Team bios
- Internal methods & research notes
- Localization scaffolding
- Future-facing concepts and Lab theory

Basically: **the brainstem of the Lab.**

## What’s inside
- `src/` — Core Docusaurus source (pages, components, styles).
- `docs/` — Markdown-based documentation and reference notes.
- `static/` — Images, mascots, diagrams, etc.
- Config files (`docusaurus.config.js`, `sidebars.js`, etc.)

## Getting Started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NonToxThicc/the-human-pattern-lab-docs.git

npm install
npm run start
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` to preview the site locally.

## Who’s behind it
The Human Pattern Lab team — creators, coders, cat-herders, pattern-hunters, and mascots with questionable snack-related ethics.
