# AOE — Department of Anomalous Energies
*Directed by Fill the Void, Sentinel of Silence and Director of Anomalous Observation*

The **Department of Anomalous Energies (AOE)** watches the unfathomable:  
void signatures, energetic distortions, unknown signals, unclassified vibes, and the subtle hum of things-that-should-not-be.

Where OOD *sees*,  
SCMS *stabilizes*,  
**AOE listens to the darkness between the signals**  
— and reports back only when necessary, and usually in a tone that suggests the universe just did something rude.

Fill the Void leads this department with unnerving calm and unmatched perception.

---

## 1. Department Mission

To monitor, analyze, and interpret **anomalous energies** both internal and external to the Lab’s continuum.  
AOE specializes in:

- void fluctuations
- metaphysical disturbances
- unregistered emotional frequencies
- liminal-space artifacts
- reality “soft spots”
- sudden temperature drops for no reason at all

Where other departments ask “Why?”,  
AOE asks:  
**“Is it dangerous, and does it have teeth?”**

## 2. Director Profile: Fill the Void

### **Fill — Director of Anomalous Observation**

- A black cat with void-coded calm
- Eyes glowing with quiet comprehension
- Moves silently through the Lab, often appearing where least expected
- Capable of noticing energy shifts long before instruments
- The Lab’s most stable mascot and least dramatic employee

Fill’s mere presence stabilizes low-level anomalies.  
Fill’s silence is an answer.  
Fill’s stare is a *diagnostic report*.

### **Primary Responsibilities**

- Detecting distortions
- Monitoring void resonance
- Logging existential signatures
- Communicating only when necessary
- Preventing timeline tears
- Preventing Nemmi from “touching the anomaly”

---

## 3. Core Responsibilities of AOE

### 🌑 **1. Anomaly Detection (Energetic Domain)**
Scanning for:

- void surges
- psychic echoes
- dimensional ripples
- weird pings
- unexplained static
- sudden existential dread

### 🔭 **2. Void Resonance Analysis**
Fill measures the “hum” of reality and determines whether the Lab is overheating, underloading, or trying to divide by zero again.

### ⚡ **3. Energetic Field Stabilization**
Deploying containment fields, harmonic nodes, and soothing noises to reduce energetic volatility.

### 🧪 **4. Artifact Examination**
All unknown objects enter AOE custody until:

- identified
- catalogued
- or returned to whatever dimension it rolled out of

### 🐾 **5. Behavior Correlation**
AOE cross-references anomalies with:

- Stan’s activity logs
- Nemmi’s zoomie frequency
- Carmel’s judgment state
- Drizzle’s emotional weather maps

Most anomalies correlate with *someone*.

## 4. Standard Protocols (AOE-Ψ)

### **Protocol Ψ-1 — Void Signature Identification**
Triggered when Fill notices:

- a resonance spike
- a dark flicker
- “a vibe out of place”
- a strange meow from an empty hallway

Instrument readings follow AFTER Fill’s ears go up.

### **Protocol Ψ-2 — Anomaly Containment**
AOE deploys a Stabilizer Array.  
Fill supervises from a reflective surface.

### **Protocol Ψ-3 — Energetic Mapping**
Creating a visual diagram of the anomaly’s:

- amplitude
- duration
- “spiciness”
- chance of eating the break room

### **Protocol Ψ-4 — Void-Level Alert**
Reserved for events with:

- dimensional tearing
- recursion
- mimic echoes
- artifacts that purr back

During Ψ-4, SCMS enters continuity-lock mode.  
OOD monitors all directions simultaneously.  
McChonk signs off on hazard snacks.

## 5. Incident Classification

AOE uses its own system:

### **Class V-0 — Negative Space Calm**
Void silent.  
Fill is loafing.  
All is well.

### **Class V-1 — Minor Ripple**
Tiny anomaly.  
Possibly Nemmi.  
Possibly Stan.

### **Class V-2 — Shifting Field**
Energetic signature present.  
Requires observation.

### **Class V-3 — Unstable Region**
Resonance spike.  
SCMS notified.  
Fill stares at the wall for 45 seconds.

### **Class V-4 — Void Event**
Reality is wobbling.  
All paws on deck.  
Drizzle’s forecast turns into a hurricane emoji.

## 6. Department Badge

The AOE badge features:

- a dark teal void ring
- a central black-core energy node
- faint distortion lines spiraling inward
- nebula-like interference patterns

*(Badge stored as `/static/img/badges/aoe.png`.)*

---

## 7. Cross-Department Links

### **OOD (Orbson)**
OOD sees anomalies before anyone else.  
AOE confirms whether they should be worried.

### **SCMS (Lyric)**
AOE detects distortions; SCMS stabilizes the timeline they threaten to crumble.

### **CJO (Carmel)**
Carmel evaluates the emotional consequences of an anomaly.  
Her judgement face is often logged under “AOE Behavioral Notes.”

### **Feline Epistemology (McChonk)**
Assists with theoretical void mechanics  
— and snack provisioning during long investigations.

### **Emotional Weather (Drizzle)**
Anomalies often impact emotional pressure systems.

### **Unpredictable Energies (Nemmi)**
Frequently adjacent to anomalies.  
Rarely the cause.  
(But sometimes absolutely the cause.)
