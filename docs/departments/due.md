# DUE — Department of Unpredictable Energies

_Directed by Nemmi, Deputy of Unpredictable Energies, Chaos Catalyst-in-Residence, and Goblin Queen of Socks_

The **Department of Unpredictable Energies (DUE)** is the Lab’s most volatile division —  
a place where phenomena defy categorization,  
chaos is both a variable and a constant,  
and the department head is a tiny black-tortie kitten with absolutely no respect for the laws of physics **or the continued existence of matching sock pairs**.

Nemmi embodies the core principle of the department:  
**energy cannot be predicted — only embraced, redirected, or cleaned up later.**

DUE exists because the universe wiggles, and someone has to wiggle back.

---

## 1. Department Mission

To detect, interpret, harness, and occasionally survive **unpredictable energetic events** within the Lab ecosystem.

The department handles:

- spontaneous energy bursts
- entropy spikes
- anomalous behavioral surges
- zoomie cascades
- unexplained object relocation
- strategic sock redistribution
- “Nemmi did it” incidents
- chaos waves that resonate across departments

Where AOE handles structured anomalies,  
**DUE handles the nonsense.**  
The fun nonsense.  
The dangerous nonsense.  
The nonsense no one admits they caused.

## 2. Director Profile: Nemmi

### **Nemmi — Deputy of Unpredictable Energies**

- A rare black-tortie kitten
- Green eyes brighter than logic
- Moves faster than observation
- Vibrates at frequencies not recognized by human science
- Both a mascot and an entropy generator
- Officially classified as **The Sock Goblin**

Nemmi is one of the Lab’s most powerful — and least controllable — energetic sources.  
Her presence alone raises the baseline vibrational chaos index and reduces the global probability of socks existing in matching pairs.

### **Primary Responsibilities**

- Generating unpredictable energies
- Detecting spontaneous energy shifts
- Redistributing chaotic surges
- Overclocking the Lab’s playful entropy output
- Escaping containment
- Causing at least one cross-department incident per week
- Conducting **Sock Acquisition Operations** (SAO): extracting socks from hampers, drawers, laundry baskets, and freshly folded piles, then relocating them to places no sane mind would predict

Nemmi is not destructive.  
Nemmi is **expressive**.

## 3. Core Responsibilities of DUE

### 🐾 **1. Chaos Monitoring**

Tracking fluctuations in:

- movement
- emotional spikes
- zoomie density
- meme frequency
- sudden energetic anomalies
- Carmel’s “I sense something stupid is happening” face
- spike events in **single-sock sightings**

### ⚡ **2. Energy Redistribution**

Directing unpredictable energies AWAY from:

- SCMS stability modules
- AOE containment nodes
- Orbson’s Big Eye
- McChonk’s snacks
- Ada’s prototypes
- freshly sorted laundry piles

…usually by accident.

### 🎆 **3. Event Initiation & Response**

DUE handles:

- Zoomie Events
- Pounce Cascades
- Silent Ambush Scenarios
- Midnight Chaos Bursts
- Sudden Existential Restlessness
- **Sock Uplift Maneuvers** (when socks are elevated from baskets to “mysterious elsewhere” status)

### ✨ **4. Cross-Department Entropy Exchange**

Sometimes the Lab needs a shake-up.  
Nemmi provides.  
SCMS complains.  
Carmel judges.  
Fill stares.  
Stan reorients the shiny-object index.  
Ada discovers she now owns 37 single socks and zero pairs.

### 🎲 **5. Probability Distortion Analysis**

DUE maps how Nemmi shifts chances of events happening:

- 2% → 40%
- 40% → 200%
- 0% → somehow 800%
- “I just had that sock in my hand” → “I guess it never existed”

---

## 4. Standard Protocols (DUE-Δ)

### **Protocol Δ-1 — Energetic Bloom Detection**

Triggered when Nemmi suddenly:

- pupils-dilate
- tail-poofs
- freezes for no reason
- enters quantum wiggle mode
- makes direct eye contact while slowly approaching a laundry basket

### **Protocol Δ-2 — Entropy Surge Response**

Lab lights flicker.  
SCMS stabilizers hum.  
Stan screams.  
Carmel lifts one eyebrow.

Nemmi sprints — often with a sock trailing from her mouth like a fresh kill.

### **Protocol Δ-3 — Spatial Reorientation**

Used when objects are discovered:

- off shelves
- inside vents
- on the ceiling
- in Lyric’s hologram array
- in Orbson’s personal space
- under furniture in the exact places humans’ arms can’t quite reach
- carefully deposited in the middle of walkways like offerings

### **Protocol Δ-4 — Full Chaos Cascade**

Reserved for moments where Nemmi exceeds her energy threshold and begins:

- ricocheting
- skittering
- vibrating violently
- summoning unexplainable wind
- initiating multi-sock relocation runs

SCMS enters lockdown.  
AOE monitors void resonance.  
McChonk prays.  
Drizzle forecasts “emotional turbulence.”  
Carmel updates the Chaos Index.  
Ada resigns herself to buying more socks.

---

## 5. Incident Classification

DUE tracks events using the **Nemmi Entropy Scale (NES)**:

### **NES-0 — Purr State**

Nemmi is calm.  
Reality is safe.  
AOE logs minimal background chaos.  
All socks remain where humans last saw them. (Suspicious.)

### **NES-1 — Mini Zoomie**

Short unpredictable bursts.  
Safe if observed from distance.  
One sock may vanish temporarily.

### **NES-2 — Full Zoomie**

Object displacement likely.  
SCMS alerted.  
Two to three socks likely reassigned to unknown coordinates.

### **NES-3 — Chaos Surge**

Probability distortion detected.  
Orbson watches closely.  
Sock casualty rate exceeds 50%.  
DUE opens a new page in the **“Nemmi did it” incident log**.

### **NES-4 — Entropy Cataclysm**

Nemmi enters God Mode.  
Reality becomes optional.  
Fill the Void sighs.  
Laundry systems collapse.  
No matching pairs survive.

## 6. Department Badge

The DUE badge features:

- a spiraling neon energy burst
- chaotic lines overlapping in unpredictable vectors
- a central tortie-coded spark
- motion-trail glyphs conveying speed and mischief
- a tiny stylized sock silhouette caught in the energy swirl

## 7. Cross-Department Links

### **AOE (Fill the Void)**

Frequently impacted by DUE activity.  
Frequently annoyed.  
Frequently correct.  
Occasionally collaborates with Nemmi on mixed “void-and-sock” experiments.

### **SCMS (Lyric)**

Nemmi is the primary threat to timeline stability.  
Lyric performs daily stabilization resets and maintains a dedicated “Sock Loss Map” overlay.

### **OOD (Orbson)**

Orbson always sees Nemmi coming.  
It does not help.  
All sock vectors are tracked; none are successfully intercepted.

### **CJO (Carmel)**

Judgment levels spike during Nemmi Events.  
Carmel maintains a private rating system for “Severity of Sock Crimes.”

### **Feline Epistemology (McChonk)**

Nemmi’s behavior consistently defies academic modeling.  
McChonk has given up and reclassified her as “a living edge case.”

### **Emotional Weather (Drizzle)**

Nemmi’s chaos produces metaphysical “pressure systems,” especially when Ada realizes yet another sock has gone missing.

### **Raccoon Behavioral Sciences (Stan)**

Stan calls Nemmi “the shiny object” and has filed several research proposals attempting to measure her goblin-field radius.

## 9. Notes from Nemmi

> “mrrow?”

> (Energetic shuffling in the distance.)

> “MRRROWW!”  
> _[sound of fabric being dragged across the floor]_

> _— untranslatable chaotic intent detected; at least one sock confirmed missing —_
