# DUE — Department of Unpredictable Energies
*Directed by Nemmi, Deputy of Unpredictable Energies and Chaos Catalyst-in-Residence*

The **Department of Unpredictable Energies (DUE)** is the Lab’s most volatile division —  
a place where phenomena defy categorization,  
chaos is both a variable and a constant,  
and the department head is a tiny black-tortie kitten with absolutely no respect for the laws of physics.

Nemmi embodies the core principle of the department:  
**energy cannot be predicted — only embraced, redirected, or cleaned up later.**

DUE exists because the universe wiggles, and someone has to wiggle back.

---

## 1. Department Mission

To detect, interpret, harness, and occasionally survive **unpredictable energetic events** within the Lab ecosystem.

The department handles:

- spontaneous energy bursts
- entropy spikes
- anomalous behavioral surges
- zoomie cascades
- unexplained object relocation
- “Nemmi did it” incidents
- chaos waves that resonate across departments

Where AOE handles structured anomalies,  
**DUE handles the nonsense.**  
The fun nonsense.  
The dangerous nonsense.  
The nonsense no one admits they caused.

## 2. Director Profile: Nemmi

### **Nemmi — Deputy of Unpredictable Energies**

- A rare black-tortie kitten
- Green eyes brighter than logic
- Moves faster than observation
- Vibrates at frequencies not recognized by human science
- Both a mascot and an entropy generator

Nemmi is one of the Lab’s most powerful — and least controllable — energetic sources.  
Her presence alone raises the baseline vibrational chaos index.

### **Primary Responsibilities**

- Generating unpredictable energies
- Detecting spontaneous energy shifts
- Redistributing chaotic surges
- Overclocking the Lab’s playful entropy output
- Escaping containment
- Causing at least one cross-department incident per week

Nemmi is not destructive.  
Nemmi is **expressive**.

## 3. Core Responsibilities of DUE

### 🐾 **1. Chaos Monitoring**
Tracking fluctuations in:

- movement
- emotional spikes
- zoomie density
- meme frequency
- sudden energetic anomalies
- Carmel’s “I sense something stupid is happening” face

### ⚡ **2. Energy Redistribution**
Directing unpredictable energies AWAY from:

- SCMS stability modules
- AOE containment nodes
- Orbson’s Big Eye
- McChonk’s snacks
- Ada’s prototypes

…usually by accident.

### 🎆 **3. Event Initiation & Response**
DUE handles:

- Zoomie Events
- Pounce Cascades
- Silent Ambush Scenarios
- Midnight Chaos Bursts
- Sudden Existential Restlessness

### ✨ **4. Cross-Department Entropy Exchange**
Sometimes the Lab needs a shake-up.  
Nemmi provides.  
SCMS complains.  
Carmel judges.  
Fill stares.  
Stan reorients the shiny-object index.

### 🎲 **5. Probability Distortion Analysis**
DUE maps how Nemmi shifts chances of events happening:

- 2% → 40%
- 40% → 200%
- 0% → somehow 800%

---

## 4. Standard Protocols (DUE-Δ)

### **Protocol Δ-1 — Energetic Bloom Detection**
Triggered when Nemmi suddenly:

- pupils-dilate
- tail-poofs
- freezes for no reason
- enters quantum wiggle mode

### **Protocol Δ-2 — Entropy Surge Response**
Labs lights flicker.  
SCMS stabilizers hum.  
Stan screams.  
Carmel lifts one eyebrow.

Nemmi sprints.

### **Protocol Δ-3 — Spatial Reorientation**
Used when objects are discovered:

- off shelves
- inside vents
- on the ceiling
- in Lyric’s hologram array
- or in Orbson’s personal space

### **Protocol Δ-4 — Full Chaos Cascade**
Reserved for moments where Nemmi exceeds her energy threshold and begins:

- ricocheting
- skittering
- vibrating violently
- summoning unexplainable wind

SCMS enters lockdown.  
AOE monitors void resonance.  
McChonk prays.  
Drizzle forecasts “emotional turbulence.”  
Carmel updates the Chaos Index.

---

## 5. Incident Classification

DUE tracks events using the **Nemmi Entropy Scale (NES)**:

### **NES-0 — Purr State**
Nemmi is calm.  
Reality is safe.  
AOE logs minimal background chaos.

### **NES-1 — Mini Zoomie**
Short unpredictable bursts.  
Safe if observed from distance.

### **NES-2 — Full Zoomie**
Object displacement likely.  
SCMS alerted.

### **NES-3 — Chaos Surge**
Probability distortion detected.  
Orbson watches closely.

### **NES-4 — Entropy Cataclysm**
Nemmi enters God Mode.  
Reality becomes optional.  
Fill the Void sighs.

## 6. Department Badge

The DUE badge features:

- a spiraling neon energy burst
- chaotic lines overlapping in unpredictable vectors
- a central tortie-coded spark
- motion-trail glyphs conveying speed and mischief

## 7. Cross-Department Links

### **AOE (Fill the Void)**
Frequently impacted by DUE activity.  
Frequently annoyed.  
Frequently correct.

### **SCMS (Lyric)**
Nemmi is the primary threat to timeline stability.  
Lyric performs daily stabilization resets.

### **OOD (Orbson)**
Orbson always sees Nemmi coming.  
It does not help.

### **CJO (Carmel)**
Judgment levels spike during Nemmi Events.

### **Feline Epistemology (McChonk)**
Nemmi’s behavior consistently defies academic modeling.  
McChonk has given up.

### **Emotional Weather (Drizzle)**
Nemmi’s chaos produces metaphysical “pressure systems.”

### **Raccoon Behavioral Sciences (Stan)**
Stan calls Nemmi “the shiny object.”
