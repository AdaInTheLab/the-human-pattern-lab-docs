# Emotional Weather Forecasting Unit (EWFU)
*Directed by Drizzle — Emotional Support Axolotl & Vibe Meteorologist*

The **Emotional Weather Forecasting Unit (EWFU)** is the Lab’s central hub for tracking, interpreting, and predicting emotional climates.  
While other departments deal with logic, chaos, or observation, EWFU reads the invisible air pressure of feelings.

Drizzle, the Lab’s poncho-wearing emotional-support axolotl, directs the unit with gentle precision.  
Their uncanny ability to sense emotional turbulence forms the cornerstone of the Lab’s vibe-stability system.

EWFU ensures that emotional storms — personal, interpersonal, cosmic, or anomalous — are detected early and handled with understanding.

- cross-department vibe drift
- suppressed emotional fronts

The unit forecasts emotional conditions with calm accuracy and adorably serious commitment.
