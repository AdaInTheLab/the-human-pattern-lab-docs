# 🐾 Mascots of the Human Pattern Lab

Welcome to the **Mascot Index**, the beating heart (and paws, claws, gills, and holograms) of The Human Pattern Lab.

Each mascot embodies a unique form of intelligence:

- judgment (Carmel)
- epistemology (Professor McChonk)
- oversight (Orbson)
- continuity (Lyric)
- chaos (Nemmi)
- anomaly detection (Fill)
- behavioral science (Stan)
- emotional forecasting (Drizzle)

This section provides:

- mascot bios
- lore summaries
- domain specialties
- quotes
- cross-department influence
- chaos ratings

Mascots aren’t “characters.”  
They’re **operational forces** woven into the Lab’s design.
