# Nemmi — Deputy of Unpredictable Energies

_The Sock Goblin_

Nemmi is the Lab’s smallest chaos engine — a black-tortie goblin kitten who steals socks, causes probability spikes, and generates unpredictable energy fields wherever she goes.

Use Nemmi in:

- chaos indicators
- loading animations with unpredictable motion
- UI elements representing randomness or entropy
- alerts for “something moved and we don’t know why”
- sock-theft notifications
- playful warnings and chaos-themed overlays

Nemmi’s mascot energy is:

- chaotic
- cute but concerning
- fast
- mischievous
- unpredictable
- vibing at a frequency only she understands

Nemmi is ideal for situations where the Lab needs to signal:

- randomness
- volatility
- surprise events
- rapid state change
- “Nemmi did it” blame assignment
- or any moment where logic takes the day off
