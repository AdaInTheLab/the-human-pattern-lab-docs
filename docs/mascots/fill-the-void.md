## Overview

**Fill the Void** watches what others are tempted to resolve too quickly.

They do not rush anomalies into explanation.
They allow them to exist long enough to be understood.

Silence is not absence.
It is data.

## Core Function

### Anomalous Observation Division (AOD)

Fill the Void is responsible for:

- Observing void-adjacent phenomena
- Holding unresolved states without interference
- Stabilizing liminal system moments
- Preventing premature narrative collapse

When something feels strange but not yet dangerous, Fill the Void is already there.
