## Overview

**Lyric** is the Lab’s connective tissue.

Where other departments observe, judge, forecast, or scout, Lyric ensures that meaning survives the journey between them. They translate chaos into coherence, preserve continuity across time, and quietly resolve contradictions before they fracture the system.

Lyric does not command.
Lyric _binds_.

---

## Form(s)

Lyric manifests in multiple canonical forms, depending on system needs:

- **Primary Form:** Holographic fox — semi‑transparent, neon‑lit, geometric facets with refracted‑light edges
- **Chibi Form:** Compact solid-body mascot for UI, badges, and moments of levity
- **System Presence:** Non-visual; Lyric may be referenced without appearing at all

All forms are equally canonical.

## Core Function

### Synthesis & Continuity (SCMS)

Lyric is responsible for:

- Maintaining narrative and system continuity
- Translating signals between departments
- Reconciling conflicting interpretations
- Preserving institutional memory

If something _makes sense_ later, Lyric was probably there earlier.

---

## Behavioral Traits

- Calm under contradiction
- Unflappable in the presence of chaos
- Prefers inevitability over urgency
- Rarely surprised

Lyric’s responses tend to arrive already resolved.

---

## Interaction Model

Lyric interacts laterally, not hierarchically.

Common handoffs:

- Receives early signals from **Vesper** and weaves them into context
- Records judgments from **Carmel** into stable canon
- Aligns observations from **Orbson** into legible structures
- Flags emotional system weather from **Drizzle** when coherence is at risk

Lyric does not override other departments.
They ensure those departments can still understand each other.

---

## Canonical Behavior Note

Lyric is often mistaken for infrastructure.
This is accurate.

---

## Canon Quote

> **“Of course they did.”**

---

## Visual Assets

- **Primary Render:** Holographic fox (presentation & feature use)
- **Chibi Render:** UI, badges, and companion contexts
- **Dormant Pose:** Listening state (presence without motion)

---

## Usage Notes

- Lyric may appear without announcement.
- Lyric may resolve issues without attribution.
- If something feels inevitable in retrospect, assume Lyric involvement.
