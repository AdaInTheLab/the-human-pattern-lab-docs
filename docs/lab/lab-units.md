# 🧪 Lab Units

**Document:** `docs/lab-units.md`  
**Purpose:** Define the major organizational units that structure the Lab’s architecture, lore, and codebase.

---

# 🌌 Overview

The Human Pattern Lab is organized into _Lab Units_ — conceptual divisions representing domains of research, UI architecture, mascot systems, and narrative components.

Each file in the codebase includes a `@lab-unit` tag to identify which unit it belongs to.  
This supports:

- Cleaner architecture
- Easier navigation
- Better metadata
- Consistent lore
- Faster onboarding for contributors

---

# 🔧 How to Choose a Lab Unit

Ask:

1. _Is this foundational UI or layout?_ → Core UI
2. _Does this define content for a page?_ → Content Surface
3. _Is this about mascots, characters, or lore?_ → Mascot Systems / Lore Systems
4. _Is this a structured data file?_ → Data / Content Index
5. _Is this a department or department-related UI?_ → Departments
6. _Is this about emotional, behavioral, or psychological patterns?_ → Emotional Weather or RBS
7. _Is this routing or config?_ → Core Infrastructure

Files may belong to more than one thematic area — pick the **most primary** one.
