# 📜 Lore Archive

The **Lore Archive** documents the vast (and occasionally unhinged) mythological framework that defines The Human Pattern Lab.

Here you will find:

- origin stories
- dimensional theories
- mascot backstories
- cosmic architectures
- continuity timelines
- interdepartmental conflicts
- cross-reality incident logs
- metaphysical protocols
- and the secrets the Void would like to keep quiet

Lore in the Lab is:

- structured like science
- narrated like mythology
- powered by mascots
- stabilized by SCMS
- observed by OOD
- and occasionally disrupted by DUE

Consult this archive whenever you need to understand **how the universe works**  
—or why it stopped working temporarily.
