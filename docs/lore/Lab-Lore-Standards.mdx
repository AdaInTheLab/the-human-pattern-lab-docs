## Mascot Lore Standard (v1.0)

Mascot lore pages follow a shared structural pattern derived from
early canonical entries (Vesper, Nemmi).

This structure balances narrative myth, operational clarity,
and relational coherence.

Sections are numbered for consistency but remain flexible
to accommodate mascot-specific systems and scales.
