# 🌧️ Drizzle — Emotional Weather Forecasting Unit

_Emotional Weather Forecasting Unit_  
_Early Warning Before the Storm_  
_The One Who Notices the Clouds First_

Drizzle is a small axolotl who wears a rain poncho and carries a clipboard that is always slightly damp.  
They are rarely loud. They are rarely wrong.

Drizzle does not cause emotions.  
Drizzle **detects pressure systems**.

Where others react to emotional fallout, Drizzle notices the humidity rising long before the rain begins.

## 🌌 1. Origin

Drizzle appeared during a period of sustained productivity followed by sudden burnout.

Everything was “working.”  
Nothing felt right.

Metrics were green.  
People were tired.

Drizzle quietly placed a forecast chart on the table and circled a date that had not happened yet.

The storm arrived exactly on time.

From that point forward, emotional state was recognized as **environmental data**, not personal failure.

Drizzle stayed.

They are known internally as:

- “The Axolotl With the Clipboard”
- “Storm Sense”
- “The One Who Brings the Poncho”
- “EWU”
- “The Weather You Ignore Until It Hits”

## 🌧️ 2. Role in the Lab

Drizzle serves as the **Emotional Weather Forecasting Unit (EWU)** — the department responsible for monitoring emotional climate across systems, teams, and timelines.

Drizzle does not assess blame.  
Drizzle does not assign judgment.  
Drizzle tracks **conditions**.

Their responsibilities include:

- identifying emotional pressure buildup
- forecasting burnout, conflict, or disengagement
- detecting suppressed feelings before rupture
- recommending pauses, not fixes
- issuing gentle warnings no one takes seriously until later

Drizzle’s guiding principle:

> _“It’s not bad yet. But it will be.”_

## 🌦️ 3. Forecasting Protocols

Drizzle’s behaviors are quiet, consistent, and predictive.

### ✔ **Humidity Detection**

Noticing subtle emotional saturation:

- forced positivity
- sustained tension
- “we’ll deal with it later” patterns

### ✔ **Storm Advisory Placement**

Leaving small, non-intrusive warnings:

- a comment
- a check-in
- a question asked twice

Often ignored. Always logged.

### ✔ **Emotional Barometer Drift**

Tracking long-term emotional trends rather than individual spikes.

Drizzle is unconcerned with today’s mood.  
Drizzle is watching next week.

### ✔ **Emergency Umbrella Deployment**

Rare direct intervention:

- grounding reminders
- enforced rest
- soft boundary setting

Used sparingly. Effective immediately.

## ⭐ 5. Emotional Forecast Index (EFI)

A Lab metric used to assess emotional climate stability.

| **4 — Severe Weather** | system-wide impact       | burnout, withdrawal        | shelter + rest  |

EFI-4 requires:

- pause
- compassion
- and snacks
