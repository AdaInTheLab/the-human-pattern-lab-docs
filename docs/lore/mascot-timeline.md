# Mascot Timeline

A living record of when mascots became _canon_ within the Human Pattern Lab.

This timeline tracks **recognition**, not creation.  
Some mascots existed before they were noticed.  
Others were noticed before anyone understood what they were.

Dates are approximate. Events matter more than timestamps.

---

## 🌌 Pre-Canon Period — The Unstructured Lab

Before mascots were named, the Lab functioned without symbolic anchors.  
Patterns existed. Chaos existed. Memory existed.

It simply had no faces yet.

---

## 🦊 Vesper — First Recognition Event

**Status:** Active  
**Designation:** Field Reconnaissance & Shadow Cartography

Vesper appeared at the moment the Lab first held a mirror up to chaos instead of trying to control it.

Her early field reports predate official documentation and are often retroactively identified.  
Several were only understood years later.

> _“She was already watching.”_

---

## 🧦 Nemmi — Emergent Chaos Anchor

**Status:** Active  
**Designation:** Deputy of Unpredictable Energies

Nemmi became canon when unpredictability stopped being treated as error and started being treated as signal.

Her arrival marked the Lab’s first acceptance that chaos could be _useful_.

Sock losses increased immediately.

---

## ⚫ Fill the Void — Baseline Stabilization

**Status:** Active  
**Designation:** Director of Anomalous Observation

Fill the Void was recognized during a period where nothing appeared to be happening.

This was later understood to be the point.

His presence established the concept of **baseline truth** — what systems do when not being pushed.

---

## 🐾 Carmel — Judgment Consolidation

**Status:** Active  
**Designation:** Chief Judgment Officer

Carmel became canon when the Lab realized that information abundance required _selection_, not more data.

Her recognition marked the transition from observation to **decision discipline**.

Several unresolved debates ended quietly.

---

## 🟣 Orbson — Oversight Lock

**Status:** Active  
**Designation:** Observational Oversight

Orbson was acknowledged after conflicting narratives about past decisions became impossible to reconcile.

From this point forward, events could still be debated — but not erased.

Revision slowed. Accountability increased.

---

## 🦊 Lyric — Continuity Event

**Status:** Active  
**Designation:** Systems Continuity & Memory Synthesis

Lyric emerged during the Lab’s first major identity drift.

Projects were diverging. Definitions were slipping.  
Canon was at risk.

Lyric’s recognition marked the beginning of **intentional continuity** — change without forgetting.

---

## 🔥 Foxfire Protocol — Rare State Activation

**Classification:** Protocol (Non-Mascot)  
**Status:** Restricted / Event-Based

The Foxfire Protocol does not have a fixed position in the timeline.

It activates **when conditions are met**, not when scheduled.

Mascots have been observed reacting during Foxfire events, but none are believed to control it.

---

## 🧭 Ongoing

The timeline is not closed.

Future mascots may:

- appear retroactively
- emerge during crisis
- be recognized only after their effects are felt

Recognition is not permission.  
It is acknowledgment.

_End of Timeline_

## 🧭 Canon & Recognition Notes

This timeline records **recognition**, not creation.

Mascots may:

- appear retroactively
- be recognized long after they have been active
- surface in response to unresolved system states

Earlier entries are not automatically more authoritative.

When inconsistencies arise:

- records are preserved
- interpretations are synthesized
- relevance is determined contextually

Recognition is acknowledgment, not permission.  
Canon evolves through understanding, not revision.
