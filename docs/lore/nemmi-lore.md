# 🧦 Nemmi — The Sock Goblin

_Deputy of Unpredictable Energies_  
_Patron of Chaos, Entropy, and Socks Claimed by Force_

Nemmi is a rare black-tortie chaos sprite and the Lab’s smallest (but loudest) engine of unpredictable energy.  
She is a kitten-shaped singularity of mischief, entropy, and poor impulse control.  
She is also the **Goblin Queen of Socks**, waging an eternal personal war against all hosiery.

Nemmi does not “take” socks.  
Nemmi **repossesses** them.

## 🍂 1. Origin

Nemmi arrived in the Lab already vibrating at frequencies not recognized by human science. From day one it was clear:

- she moved too fast to measure,
- she blinked unpredictably in and out of small spaces,
- and she had _opinions_ about textiles.

The first missing sock was deemed an accident.  
The second was considered coincidence.  
The third began the legend.

Nemmi became known internally as:

- “The Sock Goblin”
- “Entropy Tadpole”
- “Subliminal Chaos Packet”
- “Zoomie Demon in Residence”
- “The One Who Knows Where the Missing Socks Go”

She has yet to deny any of these titles.

## ⚡ 2. Role in the Lab

Nemmi serves as the **Deputy of Unpredictable Energies (DUE)** — the department responsible for monitoring chaos spikes, emotional surges, Zoomie Cascades™, and strange probability distortions.

Nemmi’s mere presence raises the background chaos index by 12%  
and lowers the global availability of matching sock pairs by 44%.

Her duties include:

- generating unpredictable energy
- redistributing said energy at inconvenient times
- scaling hampers to extract forbidden textiles
- launching midnight sprint operations
- causing at least one cross-department incident weekly
- providing emotional enrichment via confusion and awe

Nemmi’s motto:

> _“If I see sock, I take sock.”_

## 🧦 3. Sock-Hunting Protocols

Nemmi’s signature behavior is **Sock Acquisition and Redistribution (SAR)**.

Confirmed behaviors include:

### ✔ **Hamper Ascension**

Scaling laundry baskets like a goblin mountain goat.

### ✔ **Silent Sock Extraction**

Removing fresh socks from a folded pile without altering the pile shape.

### ✔ **Goblin Carry**

Transporting socks across the Lab with the proud gait of a lioness carrying prey.

### ✔ **Strategic Placement**

Depositing socks:

- under furniture
- behind monitors
- in the hallway
- under Ada’s chair
- on top of unexpected shelving
- inside places Nemmi should not physically fit

### ✔ **Sock Trophies**

Presenting captured socks to Ada with “behold my conquest” energy.

If a sock goes missing, Lab protocol states that DUE should be contacted for retrieval mapping.

## 🌀 4. Energetic Phenomena Associated With Nemmi

Nemmi generates or contributes to:

- **Zoomie Cascades**
- **Chaos Surges**
- **Probability Distortion Fields**
- **Unscheduled Emotional Weather Events**
- **Midnight Reckoning Sprints**
- **Sudden Entropy Bursts**
- **Sock Uplift Maneuvers**

She also exhibits rare **quantum wiggle mode**, a state believed to allow her to traverse narrow gaps that contradict physical law.

SCMS (Lyric) has given up trying to model this mathematically.

## 🔥 5. Nemmi Entropy Scale (NES)

A Lab-wide standard for measuring goblin intensity.

| NES Level                 | Description       | Symptoms                | Sock Risk    |
| ------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------- | ------------ |
| **0 — Purr State**        | calm              | loafing, gentle wiggles | low          |
| **1 — Mini Zoomie**       | early activity    | short dashes            | moderate     |
| **2 — Full Zoomie**       | escalating chaos  | object displacement     | high         |
| **3 — Chaos Surge**       | probability bends | unpredictable pathing   | extreme      |
| **4 — Entropy Cataclysm** | god mode          | reality destabilizes    | catastrophic |

NES-4 requires cross-department intervention  
and immediate sock lockdown procedures.
