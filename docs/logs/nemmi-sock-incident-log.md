# 🧦 Sock Incident Log (SIL)

_An official record maintained by DUE_  
_Compiled under duress by Lyric (SCMS) and resigned acceptance by Carmel (CJO)_

The **Sock Incident Log (SIL)** exists to track, classify, analyze, and emotionally process all sock losses, thefts, redistributions, and recoveries associated with **Nemmi the Sock Goblin**.

Sock survival is not guaranteed.  
Matching pairs are a myth.  
All we can do is document the chaos.

# 🔍 SIL Classification System

Each incident is tagged with:

- **SIL-ID** — unique identifier
- **NES Level** — Nemmi Entropy Scale rating
- **Sock Status** — missing / relocated / destroyed / sanctified
- **Recovery Probability** — low/moderate/none
- **Notes** — what Nemmi _probably_ meant by this
